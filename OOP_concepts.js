/* 
What is Object Orientend Programing?
- relies on the concept of classes and objects
- used to structure a software program into simple, 
reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 
which are used to create individual instances of objects. 
- Object-oriented programming languages include:
 JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python

What is a class?
- an abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects
- classes often represent broad categories, like Car or Dog that share attributes
- classes are templates for objects

What is an object?
- Objects are instances of class

What are the benefits of OOP?
- Allows for class-specific behavior through polymorphism
- Easier to debug
- Secure, protects information through encapsulation
- Reusable, can be used across programs
** implementing OOP allows for better data structures and reusability, saving time

Summary: Four principles of OOP
1) Encapsulation --> Data hiding using getters and setters
2) Abstraction ---> We care about Interface. Not the implementation behind the hood
3) Inheritance ---> Extending classes... Access modifiers: public, private, modifier
4) Polymorphism --> Same methods' name, but different implementations of methods.
