/*
Inheritance
Main points:
- allows classes to derive from other classes

- 3 main access modifiers:
    - public: can be accessed from anywhere in your program
    - private: can only be accessed from within the same class that the member is defined
    - protected: can be accessed within the class it is defined

- eliminates redunant code
