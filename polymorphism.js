/*
Polymorphism:
- describes methods that are able to take on many forms

- 2 types:
    - Dynamic: when a method signature is in both subclass and superclass
    - Static: when multiple methods with the same name but different 
    arguments are defined in the same class

* key points:
- Allows methods to take on many forms
- when utilizing polymorphism and method overloading, 
be sure to call the correct form of method
