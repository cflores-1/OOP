/*
Abstraction
* main idea:
- refers to the idea of only showing essential details and keeping everything else hidden
- 

* key point:
- allows the program to worked on incrementally and prevents it from
becoming entangled and complex
- determine specific points of contact that can act as an interface between
classes, and only worry about the implementation when coding
